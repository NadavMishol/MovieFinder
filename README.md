The conditions include 

Steps the program should follow:
1.	Accept optional user-set conditions like: date, genre, actor, minimum rate
2.	Download the most recent version

4.	Filter the data according to the user preferences
5.	Sort it according to the preferences of the user
6.	Generate a response of top X matches 
7.	The response will include the title of the movie, itâ€™s rate a link to the IMDB page.
